About Project  :  
KRYPTOINN is a free to use website where we can check the current market value of cryptocurrency, Compare how much we can get one cryptocurrency  by clicking at get started option ,if we convert it to other by just clicking on the converter button. Not only that, we can also track the last 30 days performance of the cryptocurrency through graph by just clicking on the crypto’s at crypto tracker. But for all this feature the only thing we have to do is either register or signup through google account . We maintaian the data as in who logged in by the use of firebase database.For singing in you have to click at either register or sign in tab.
We have used the API of coingecko website. link:https://www.coingecko.com/api/documentations/v3
to extract the informations like coi  price, logos, market cap . 

Tools Used:
	HTML
	CSS
	JAVA SCRIPT
	NODE JS
	REACT JS
	FIREBASE


Reason for using the tools:

NODE JS:   
1. Easy to learn
Node.js has no steep learning curve. Coding in Node.js is relatively easy to grasp, once you have mastered JavaScript and Object Oriented Programming basics. It’s enough to start.
There are plenty of interactive courses, tutorials and examples on github, which can make your learning a really pleasant experience.  
2. Keeping things simple
 If we  step into the Node.js, we really enjoy easy sharing one language both on server and client sides, and no necessity to switch between back-end and front-end.
This means, that applications written in Node.js require fewer files and less code compared to those with different languages for front-end and back-end. 
3. Faster time-to-market
The first thing is that the technology is lightweight and can massively reduce the application development time while achieving the same functionality. With Node, you can get from idea to product in a snap. Secondly, dead simple deployments help you get immediate feedback from the production environment.
4. Scalability
Scalability is baked into the core of Node.js. It is one of Node’s basic benefits for startups who are planning to grow with the course of time. App-based startups choose it to develop lightweight and fast systems with good real-time response that can be scaled up later, as well as to easily add more modules to the existing ones. You never know how high will you go.
5. Battle-tested old hand
If you are concerned with the relative novelty of Node.js, don’t worry. In the past few years the number of companies using Node.js for their products has increased dramatically, and the giants like PayPal, Netflix and eBay have joined the hype.
Surely, Node.js is a mature and well-tested tool, and it is not going to be neglected or abandoned any time soon.
6. MVP development
Node.js enables to quickly develop an MVP (minimum viable product)  – a piece of software with just enough features (or a single killer feature) so that the product can go to the market and satisfy the first customers. MVP is a rudimentary stage on the way to a full-fledged application.
7. Community
An active community means a lot of support and feedback. Again, thriving Node.js community can help you avoid reinventing a bicycle – they have produced multiple tools and decent instruments that accelerate the development speed.


REACT JS:   
	 It facilitates the overall process of writing components
	It boosts productivity and facilitates further maintenance
	It ensures faster rendering

	It guarantees stable code
	It comes with a helpful developer toolset


FIRE BASE:   
	Reliable & Extensive Databases
Firebase works under the flag of Google, and that’s why it provides powerful databases for web and mobile application development. We are going to discuss major Firebase databases with their advantages below:
	Realtime Database
No doubt, Realtime database was the first product that didn’t lose its charm till now. Firebase Realtime database allows applications to approach cross-platform data within realtime after joining NoSQL cloud-storage. This Realtime database also enables you to work without internet connectivity. Even data is still being cached in the memory of your device when you are offline and start synchronizing after the internet connectivity.
Besides, the integration of Firebase Authentication feature also deals with the data security concerns of users. Yes, when you use a Realtime database, you can set the data permissions, which is another great advantage of using Firebase.
	Cloud Firestore
Another advantage of Firebase is its Cloud Firestore. This NoSQL database makes it easy for programmers to transfer and store data for front and backend development. This cloud database is also known for its Realtime updates, flexible data models, offline support, and quick data inquiries.
By the same token, Cloud Firestore also provides smooth integration with Google Cloud and other Firebase products. With these products, you can access extensive data for your app development projects. Withal, to overcome the security-related concerns of programmers, Cloud Firestore is using Identity and Access Management (IAM) and strict data protection rules.
Fast & Safe Hosting
Another appealing advantage of Firebase is its secure & fast hosting services. Firebase hosting supports all content types, including web applications, dynamic and static content. Moreover, either we want to host your Express.js microservices, HTML, CSS, or APIs, the hosting support of Firebase is always there. It means Firebase hosts a diverse variety of content.
Provides A Free Start to Newbies
As we are a newbie programmer and willing to know the core advantage of Firebase,we can. consider its ‘free start’ feature. Yes, Firebase allows coders to develop their applications without investing a single penny. With the free services of Firebase, it is convenient for beginners to understand how their app works in a real environment.
Free Multi-Platform Firebase Authentication
User identity has vital in maintaining the security of applications. In this challenging online security environment, Google-backed Firebase Authentication is one of the most appealing advantages of this platform. It caters easy-to-integrate SDKs, UI libraries and server-side services to verify users before using a particular Firebase application.
